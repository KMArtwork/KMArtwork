## üß¨ About Me :
I enjoy the creative thinking and problem solving that comes with coding. There's nothing quite like the feeling of finally figuring out a tough problem and breaking through barriers.

I'm a huge nerd and when I'm not coding I'm probably gaming, making art, or getting sucked into the algorithm and endlessly watching animal videos.

I want to use my skills as a developer to help contribute towards addressing systemic issues like healthcare, wildlife/environmental conservation, social equity, etc.
